Watch the [Nitwits livestream](https://youtu.be/GSk8QX-0qoo) were Dylan Ferguson explains the basics of python with these scripts as examples.

### Known Issues
The two secureCRT based scripts have yet to be tested since:

1. SecureCRT has terrible scripting documentation (only examples are provided python)
2. UOIT Networking Lab is not accesible by Networking/IT students if they are not currently in a intro/advance networking course
